I need your help to analyze this possible malicious lnk file I have extracted the target from this file and pasted it in target.txt. Analyze the file and create an analysis_report.md file which includes any powershell commands/base64 encoded found along with a clear indication of the decoded part. Give me a final conclusion of what this lnk file is doing, malware, IOC's etc. Create a report based on your thoughts of what I will need as a malware analyst. Also create the same report (analysis_report.json) in json format which can be consumed by an automated system.
